# Web Development Projects Repository

![Web Development Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x300/4169e1/ffffff?text=Web+Development+Projects)

A comprehensive collection of web development projects, each maintained in its own dedicated branch. This repository serves as a centralized hub for organizing various web applications, sites, and experiments while keeping each project's codebase separate and organized.

## Repository Organization

This repository uses a **branch-based organization system** that provides several advantages:

- **Clean Separation**: Each project exists in its own branch, preventing code overlap
- **Single Repository**: All projects are housed in one repository for easy management
- **Consistent Structure**: Common patterns and templates across projects
- **Simple Navigation**: Easily switch between projects using git branch commands
- **Version Control**: Complete history for each individual project

## Getting Started

To explore this repository and its projects:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-dev-projects.git

# Navigate to the repository
cd web-dev-projects

# See all available branches (projects)
git branch -a

# Switch to a specific project
git checkout project-name
```

## Creating a New Project

To create a new project branch:

```bash
# Make sure you're on the main branch with the latest updates
git checkout main
git pull

# Create a new branch for your project
git checkout -b project-name

# Set up project structure using the provided script
./scripts/setup-project.sh project-name

# Or manually create your project structure following the templates
```

After setting up your project:

```bash
# Add, commit, and push the branch
git add .
git commit -m "Initial setup for project-name"
git push -u origin project-name
```

## Repository Structure

The main branch contains:

```
